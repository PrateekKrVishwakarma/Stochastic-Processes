\title{\textbf{SPQT PROJECT PROPOSAL}\\ Online Learning of Hitting Time of Markov Chains}
\author{Chandramouli K}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Motivation}
\par The function of communication channels is history dependent in general.
It is common to model communication channels using Markov Chains. In this scenario learning
hitting times can result in fast transmition by detecting active channels.
Further learning hitting times has applications in stabilizing queues with applications to 
parking etc. 

\section{System model/Problem Statement}
There are $N$ channels each modeled as a Markov chain. 
The goal of the project is to find the Markov chain that hits state 1 quickly. 
We plan to model this as a multi-armed bandit problem and modify and apply existing algorithms to
this framework
