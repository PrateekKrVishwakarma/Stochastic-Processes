\section{Motivation}
Why should we be interested in this problem?
\section{System Model}
These modeling assumptions make the problem analytically tractable and extract important features.
\section{Problem Statement}
Precuse problem of interest.
\subsection{Justification}
How is the problem novel, compared to the existing literature?
\section{Plan}
In next one month and a half, how do you plan to solve this problem?
\section{General guide lines}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the environment definitions for lemma, theorem, definition, proof, example, and other such environments you may need, wherever nexessary. Usage of {\bf Definition} for a definition is not acceptable. Different environments are listed in this document below.
\item Add the .tex file header in your latex file for the below commands to work (\textbackslash input\{header\}, second line of the source file sampleLecture.tex).
\item Make sure that there are no spelling mistakes in the scribed notes.
\item Use environments such as align, equations, eqnarray or gather to deal with multi-line equations, instead of newline characters. 
\item Use punctuation in all equations.
\item Always make sure that the lecture notes uploaded is complete.
\item Any math symbol in a line should be within math environment \$\$. For example, \$Y\$ is used to write a math symbol $Y$.
\item Revise your lectures before uploading, so that there no variations in the style in which the document is prepared.
\item If you are using figures in the tex file, put them in the Figures folder.
\item Please label and caption the figures.
\item Use full sentences for captions as well, and even when writing equations.
\item Motivate each section with a sentence or two, on why are we studying this?
\end{itemize}
